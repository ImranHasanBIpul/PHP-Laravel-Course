## Assignment:- 

#### Question 01:

Let’s make a result grade calculator…

Rishita’s subject marks: SubjectA = 75, SubjectB = 80, SubjectC = 65, SubjectD = 90.

Result Calculation formula: Sum all subjects marks and divided by total subject quantity. 

From this given formula, you will get a mark. Show the Grade message by the mark.

A+ = 80 - 100 

A   = 70 - 79

A-  = 60 - 69

B   = 50 - 59

C   = 40 - 49

F   = 01 - 39 

Firstly you have to calculate the average mark of Rishita.

Secondly you have to show the grade message (Like as: “You got A+”) by following this grading range.


#### Question 02: 

Let’s make a game with your bike… You are riding a bike, your bike has some functionalities, these are… start, stop, break, gear, signal, headlight. 

When you click on the power/start button, your bike takes a start, 

When you click stop, your bike takes a stop, 

When you press the break, your bike take break, 

when you give the gear, your bike move faster and faster, 

when you press the signal button, your bike shows a signal light.

When you press the headlight button, your bike’s headlight will start.

Solve this game using Switch case and submit it on github.

### Over View:
	
Operator: Increment (++) and Decrement (--)

- For Loop

- While loop

- Do while

- Foreach	

## Assignment:-
	
### Question 01:

Your client said that he needs a dropdown, which contains all days of the running month. Sometimes we fill up a registration form that, which date of birth. So find out in google (get number of days in specific month php) and do this assignment using a for loop.

- Day quantity is not equal for every month. Like as - february - 28, March - 31, april - 30

- So days of running month should dynamic (by php build in function)


### Question 02: 

If we print 1-100, our output will be 100 times. But this time you have print out only the odd (বিজোড়) number within 1-100.

- You have to rotate from 1 to 100.

- Your output message should like that, “3 is a odd number”

- Not need to print even number

	
### Question 03: 

Factorial - I think everyone knows the word. Factorial of 4 is given below:

- 4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24

- 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720  

- So let’s calculate the factorial of 7.


### Question 04: 

- Print out from 100 - 1 using a while loop. 

- You must use decrement operator

	

### Question 05: 

You have an array of your purchased product items. 

- ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'mango']

- Show all products as a table list.

- Output should like that: “sl- 1 and product - apple”
